# Sentiment Analysis

I have don't a decent enough coding with **R**, but nothing has made me as happy as doing **Sentiment Analysis**. 

I love looking at what people think about *Tendulkar*, *Kohli*, *Modi* or *Trump*. 

Here is a small (not so *small*) repo of sentiment analysis codes written in **R**. 

I will regularly update it.

Please fork and contribute if you wish to.
